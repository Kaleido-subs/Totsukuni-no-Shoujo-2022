I wish I wasn't young ????
this stair I'll sit and calm my fear
and tear everything all down 'round me
it's a good day to move on ????
{honestly since the Engrish isn't in official lyrics we can skip them}

soyogu mori wa
kaze no kioku desu ka

do the swaying trees hold
memories of the gentle wind

wareta kajitsu ga
hakonda mono wa

what was held inside the
fruit as it split at the skin

tabibito wa
nani wo mitsukeru no deshou

I do wonder what
the traveler will find in their journeys?

hoshi ha sono yume wo
mitashimasuka

will the stars grant them what they wish
for while the sun is out

oshiete
doushite?
moshimo owari ga aru no nara

oh please tell me
the reasons if
there's an end to all of this after what we see

kotaete
sore de ii
hitotsu ni nareru nara

your answers will
work just fine with me
if we can be together now still

katachi nai nani ka wo motomenagara
kyou made samayoi tsudzukemashita

I've wandered from place to place seeking something with no form
aimlessly I walked, as I braved through every storm

meguri utsurou kono sekai no naka de
kawaranai mono ga arimashita

in this ever-changing volatile world we live in
there are some things that will never change through thick and thin

arigatou
genya ni hibiki watatta
kodama no you ni

my grateful words
can be heard filling through the emptiness
of these lands before me

arigatou
nando demo
mizu no kagami ni utsuru
hikari no wa no you ni ima

I'll say "Thank you"
countless times to you
as many as the stars that are shown
in this mirror of a lake now tonight
